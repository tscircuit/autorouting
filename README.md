A dataset of autorouting problems for benchmarking ðŸ¥‡, plus a ton of utilities ðŸ”¨ including a viewer and testing server
for developing new autorouting algorithms.

Autorouting is the process of drawing traces (wires) to connect chips on a PCB. It is a decades-old largely unsolved
problem.

## What is autorouting?

Autorouting
is the drawing of traces (wires) across a 2d surface to connect
copper pads together. Traces can go underneath pads using a
copper-plated hole called a "via". Traces must also avoid "obstacles"
which are other pads or blocked areas where a trace cannot pass
such as a hole or region designated for an antenna.

## Problems

There are different classifications of problems, each problem
applies to a different autorouting scenario. A perfect autorouter
can solve all of these problems, but partial autorouting is
very useful for human-assisted routing.

## Benchmarks

There are several criteria we use for running benchmarks:

- Speed (machine specs TBD)
- Percent of Boards fully routed inside category
- Quality (as compared to "ideal routing")
  - How much longer are the traces? Shorter traces are usually better
  - How good is the trace width relative to the ideal routing
- Problem Type
- Incremental Speed (speed if a single component is moved or a trace is changed)
- Memory Usage

Over time, we'd like to have a simple 2d chart showing Speed and Quality.

## Usage

This dataset is composed of thousands of files in the [tscircuit soup format](https://docs.tscircuit.com/api-reference/advanced/soup). You
can find a dataset for each problem tscircuit in the [datasets](./datasets) directory. You can download a [`zip` file](#) containing the datasets
from the [releases page](#). If your solver is in typescript, you can generate the datasets on the fly by importing `autorouting-dataset`

soup can be easily visualized and contains a lot of metadata that can be used for constraints. However, you may want to use the `getSimpleRouteJson`
utility function from `autorouting-dataset` to convert it into a simple object with the following interface:

```tsx
interface SimpleRouteJson {
  layerCount: number
  obstacles: Array<{
    type: "rect"
    center: { x: number; y: number }
    width: number
    height: number
  }>
  connections: Array<{
    name: string
    pointsToConnect: Array<{ x: number; y: number }>
  }>
  bounds: { minX: number; maxX: number; minY: number; maxY: number }
}
```

Each directory in the `datasets` directory contains a dataset for each problem. The `code` directory contains the code to generate datasets.

## Writing a Solver

You can write a solver in any language you want, but currently most of the examples are in Typescript. You can read about building a "hello world" autorouter in [this blog post.](https://blog.autorouting.com/p/building-a-grid-based-pcb-autorouter)

> Hate Javascript? Skip to [building a non-typescript solver](#non-typescript-solvers)

> [!NOTE]
> There are tons of examples of solvers inside the [algos directory!](./algos/)

### Typescript Solvers

Typescript solvers can accept either [tscircuit soup](https://docs.tscircuit.com/api-reference/advanced/soup) or [`SimpleRouteJson`](#usage). To develop
your Typescript solver, just create a file like this:

```tsx
import { startAutoroutingDevServer, getSimpleRouteJson } from "autorouting-dataset"

const mySolver = (soup: AnyCircuitElement[]) => {
  const routeJson = getSimpleRouteJson(soup)

  // ...

  // ...return one or more pcb_trace objects with our solution!
  return [
    {
      "type": "pcb_trace",
      "route": [
        {
          "route_type": "wire",
          "x": 3,
          "y": 1,
          "width": 5,
          "layer": "top"
        },
        {
          "route_type": "via",
          "x": 3,
          "y": 1,
          "from_layer": "top",
          "to_layer": "bottom"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

startAutoroutingDevServer({
  solver: mySolver,
  port: 3080
})
```

You can then run this file with `bun --hot ./solver-server.ts`

> [!TIP]
> Try it out with `bun ./algos/tscircuit-builtin/server.ts`

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend putting the solver in a separate file then importing it inside your server file, this way
> you can easily export your solver as a library!

### Non-Typescript Solvers

> [!TIP]
> Check out a [simple python autorouter](./algos/python-simple-grid)

- Host a server with your algorithm (see the simple flask server below)
- Run `npx autorouting-dataset server start --solver-url http://localhost:1234` (replace `localhost:1234` with your solver server url
- To benchmark your solver, run `npx autorouting-dataset benchmark --solver-url http://localhost:1234` [see running benchmarks without typescript](#running-benchmarks-without-typescript)

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from autoroute import autoroute

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/solve', methods=['POST'])
def solve():
    simple_route_json = request.json['simple_route_json']

    solution = autoroute(simple_route_json)

    return jsonify({
        "solution_soup": solution
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=1234)
```

The autorouting-dataset dev server will send a `POST` request to the provided
url with the a JSON payload containing the following fields:

```ts
interface Payload {
  problem_soup: Array<AnyCircuitElement>
  simple_route_json: SimpleRouteJson
}
```

You must return a JSON array containing `pcb_trace` elements in the following
format:

```ts
interface Response {
  solution_soup: Array<{
    type: "pcb_trace"
    route: Array<{
      route_type: "wire" | "via"
      x: number
      y: number
      width: number
      layer: string
    }>
  }>
}
```

## Visualizing Problems/Solutions

You can visualization your algorithm against a sample using the dev server. To
start the dev server, just run `npx autorouting-dataset server start --solver-url <solver-url>`
and run your solver server.

When you're debugging your solver, you may want to insert additional elements
into your solution_soup to help debug visually. To do this, just return elements
in addition to or instead of the `pcb_trace` element. A full list of elements
can be found in the [tscircuit json format (soup)](https://docs.tscircuit.com/api-reference/advanced/soup).

One easy element you can add is a [`fabrication_note_path`](https://docs.tscircuit.com/api-reference/advanced/soup#pcb-fabrication-note-path), which is shown in gray on the PCB viewer. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "type": "pcb_fabrication_note_path",
  "layer": "top",
  "route": [
    {
      "x": "3mm",
      "y": "1mm"
    },
    {
      "x": "3mm",
      "y": "1mm"
    }
  ],
  "stroke_width": "0.1mm"
}
```

You could also add a [`pcb_fabrication_note_text`](https://docs.tscircuit.com/api-reference/advanced/soup#pcb-fabrication-note-text) to add helpful text annotations:

```json
{
  "type": "pcb_fabrication_note_text",
  "font": "tscircuit2024",
  "font_size": "1mm",
  "text": "Hello, World!",
  "layer": "top",
  "anchor_position": {
    "x": "3mm",
    "y": "1mm"
  },
  "anchor_alignment": "top_left"
}
```

### Running a Dev Server with Typescript

If you're using Typescript, you can run a dev server
with the code below:

```ts
import { startDevServer } from "autorouting-dataset"
import { autoroute } from "./my-autorouter"

await startDevServer({
  solver: autoroute,
  solverName: "my-autorouter",
  port: 3080,
})
```

> [!TIP] > `export DEBUG=autorouting-dataset*` will give you all the debug output
> including additional dropdown debug information

> [!TIP]
> Check out [this directory](./algos/simple-grid/) for a typical Typescript autorouter configuration

## Running a Benchmark

### Running Benchmarks with Typescript

If you have a Typescript solver, you can run a benchmark programmatically using:

```tsx
import { runBenchmark } from "benchmark"
import mySolver from "./my-solver"

const result = await runBenchmark({
  solver: mySolver,
  verbose: true,
})
```

You can then just run your file with `bun ./benchmark.ts`

> [!TIP]
> Try it out with `bun ./algos/tscircuit-builtin/benchmark.ts`

### Running Benchmarks without Typescript

```bash
autorouting-dataset benchmark --solver-url http://localhost:1234
```

See the section on [customizing benchmarks](#customizing-benchmarks) for more details
on how to change the sample count, customize the problem type etc.

## CLI Usage

You can use the CLI to generate datasets, run benchmarks, and start a dev server.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g autorouting-dataset
```

### Starting Dev Servers

The dev server helps you visualize a dataset and will automatically send data
to your solver to test it.

The dev server will start on port 3080 by default, after you start the dev server
you can visit `http://localhost:3080` to view the dev server.

```bash
# Start the dev server with the default grid-based solver
autorouting-dataset server start

# Start the dev server with a custom solver url
autorouting-dataset server start --solver-url http://localhost:1234

# You can send specify
autorouting-dataset server start --port 3080
```

### Running Benchmarks

Runs a benchmark against a solver server. See [running benchmarks without typescript](#running-benchmarks-without-typescript) for more details.

```bash
autorouting-dataset benchmark --solver-url http://localhost:1234
```

#### Customizing Benchmarks

| Option        | Flag             | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `sampleCount` | `--sample-count` | Number of samples to run for each problem type    |
| `problemType` | `--problem-type` | Problem type to run benchmarks for (default: all) |
| `verbose`     | `--verbose`      | Prints out more information                       |
| `solverUrl`   | `--solver-url`   | URL of the solver to benchmark                    |
| `sampleSeed`  | `--sample-seed`  | Seed to randomize sampling (default: 0)           |
| `noSkipping`  | `--no-skipping`  | Disables skipping of problem types                |

By default, running a benchmark will run for 100 samples against all problem types.

> If no `problemType` is provided and the solver fails on the first 10 samples, it will
> not run the remaining samples of the problem type. You can disable this behavior
> by setting `noSkipping` to `true`

The sample count can be changed with the `--sample-count` flag. For public evaluations
the sample count should be set to at least 1,000.

### Generating Datasets

```bash
autorouting-dataset generate-dataset --problem-type single-trace --output ./single-trace-problem-XXX.json
```

This command will generate a dataset of 100 problems (by default) for the specified problem type, saving each problem as a separate JSON file.

### Generating Single Problems

To generate a single problem:

```bash
autorouting-dataset generate-problem --problem-type single-trace --seed 0 --output ./single-trace-problem-0.json
```

This command generates a single problem of the specified type with the given seed and saves it to the specified output file.
